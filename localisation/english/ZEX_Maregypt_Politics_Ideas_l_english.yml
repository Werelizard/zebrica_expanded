 traditional_pharaonism:0 "Authoritarian Pharaonism"
 traditional_pharaonism_desc:0 "Authoritarian Pharaonism - or classical Pharaonism - denotes a despotic, monarchial ideology centered around the unifying figure of a monarch acting in the stead of the divine. While undemocratic by nature, Authoritarian Pharaonism does not seek to build a totalitarian state. Rather, it emphasises traditionalism, agrarianism, the role of the Pharaoh, national restoration and third positioning. It is opposed to both Harmony and Communism, while keeping itself distinct from Supremacist beliefs by rejecting nationalism, building on Maregypt's past rather than a dictatorial view of the future."
 harmonic_pharaonism:0 "Benevolent Pharaonism"
 harmonic_pharaonism_desc:0 "Benevolent Pharaonism combines the divine mandate of classical Maregyptian Pharaonism, recognising the monarch  as a quasi-deity - or rather, a divine agent - and his or her role as the custodian of the Neighle valley, with elements of Harmonic philosophy. It emphasises inderect royal rule, friendship, peaceful co-existence and the preservation of the natural world. While not entirely authoritarian, Pharaonism is necessarily anti-democratic as only the monarch and their close council are viewed as endowed with political agency. A unique method of government blending past and future, benevolent Pharaonism straddles the thin line seperating the optimism of harmony and the harsh, sun-bathed philosophy of the Maregypt of old."

 ZEX_MGY_Breadbasket_desc:0 "Maregypt is a country which has been defined by its agriculture. Food exports - such as wheat, olives, dates and raisins - form the backbone of the country's economy. This has naturally led to a heavy reliance on the agricultural sector at the expense of the development of industrial capabilities. Problematic as that may be the royal household has always been able to judiciously put the profits from the yearly harvest to use."
 ZEX_Unfinished_Constitution_desc:0 "The constitution of February 1005, which some refer to as 'the Vizier's decree', is the brain child of the Vizier Sha Doof. Rather than being a properly legally binding document however, it is more aptly described as a list of promises and guarantees to both the populace and the ever more radical republican movement. Without the royal diet to ratify its passage it has sat - an ineffective piece of paper - for almost two years now."
 ZEX_MGY_Equestrian_Debts_desc:0 "In the wake of the Storm King's rise and fall, King Khefer negotiated an unpopular agreement with princess Celestia herself in order to salvage the country's economy. While this proved somewhat successfull in avoiding an immediate collapse of the Maregyptian economy, the payments for this assistance has now come due, driving the Maregyptian economy further towards bankruptcy."
