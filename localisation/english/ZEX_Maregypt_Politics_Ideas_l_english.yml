 #Ideologies
 traditional_pharaonism:0 "Authoritarian Pharaonism"
 traditional_pharaonism_desc:0 "Authoritarian Pharaonism - or classical Pharaonism - denotes a despotic, monarchial ideology centered around the unifying figure of a monarch acting in the stead of the divine. While undemocratic by nature, Authoritarian Pharaonism does not seek to build a totalitarian state. Rather, it emphasises traditionalism, agrarianism, the role of the Pharaoh, national restoration and third positioning. It is opposed to both Harmony and Communism, while keeping itself distinct from Supremacist beliefs by rejecting nationalism, building on Maregypt's past rather than a dictatorial view of the future."
 harmonic_pharaonism:0 "Benevolent Pharaonism"
 harmonic_pharaonism_desc:0 "Benevolent Pharaonism combines the divine mandate of classical Maregyptian Pharaonism, recognising the monarch  as a quasi-deity - or rather, a divine agent - and his or her role as the custodian of the Neighle valley, with elements of Harmonic philosophy. It emphasises inderect royal rule, friendship, peaceful co-existence and the preservation of the natural world. While not entirely authoritarian, Pharaonism is necessarily anti-democratic as only the monarch and their close council are viewed as endowed with political agency. A unique method of government blending past and future, benevolent Pharaonism straddles the thin line seperating the optimism of harmony and the harsh, sun-bathed philosophy of the Maregypt of old."

 ZEX_MGY_idea_Breadbasket_desc:0 "Maregypt is a country which has - since its inception - been broadly defined by a quasi-reliance on its agriculture as both its main export and its main source of labour, with an overwhleming majority of the populace working the fields. In more broad terms this has led to a stagnation of its industrial sector in favour of a more rural urbanscape."
 ZEX_MGY_idea_the_fading_sun_desc:0 "Maregypt is no longer the realm it was. Once, it was the envy of all of Zebrica. Now it is but a ruin, a blend of urban sprawl, dirty roads, disaffected estates and abandoned mines sitting admist a field of millenia-old pyramids, temples and desert. A dying empire, it stands as one of the last fading bastions of Harmonic governance on the continent - with the ideals of old growing ever more umpopular as the days go by."
 ZEX_MGY_idea_Equestrian_Debts_desc:0 "In the wake of the Storm King's rise and fall, King Khefer negotiated an unpopular agreement with princess Celestia herself in order to salvage the country's economy. While this proved somewhat successfull in avoiding an immediate collapse of the Maregyptian economy, the payments for this assistance has now come due, driving the Maregyptian economy further towards bankruptcy."

 ZEX_MGY_idea_maredjay_elite_desc:0 "The Maredjay - the King's royal elite - have long been granted a near-total dominance of the military, dictating its tactics, training regimens, selection process and even choosing the army's leadership. Whilst the situation has certainly helped in granting Maregypt an edge through these elite regiments, the Maredjay's stubborness has trapped our army in the past, leaving it ill-equipped to fight the conflicts of tomorrow."
