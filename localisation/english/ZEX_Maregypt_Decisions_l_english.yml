 ZEX_MAREGYPT_PARLIAMENT_CATEGORY_desc:0 "Throughout the history of Maregypt, the Kings and Queens have time and time again called upon the support of the Royal Diet; a legal body consisting of the governors - or Nomarchs - from all of the provinces of Maregypt.\n\nIn order to pass [Root.GetLeader]'s reforms, we will need to secure a majority in the Royal Diet, or a minimum of §g151§! seats. This will be no easy task however: the representatives have brought with them agendas of their own, and the emerging factions will seek to gain dominance over the diet - allowing them to dictate the direction of the reforms."
