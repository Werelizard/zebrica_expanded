 ZEX_MGY_INTRO_DESC:0 "The §FKingdom of Maregypt§!, the jewel of the Neighle, harmony’s stronghold in §YZebrica§!, once basked in the glory of its empire, a realm which centuries ago stretched from Zongola to Coltoba, exacting tribute from all the would-be princelings and warlords that roamed the Zebharan sands.\n\nBut time is cruel, and Maregypt can now only languish in the shadow of the pyramids of past, greater kings. The country lays in practical ruins, an agricultural rump all but holding its ravaged economy from complete bankruptcy; the §CStorm King's§! rampage pummeled the Kingdom’s armies to nothing, robbing it of its last great monarch and princes, spreading misery and defeat wherever the Yetis marched. Had it not been for §0Equestria§! - there might very well not be a Maregypt to speak of.\n\nAnd somehow, things have only gotten worse: §YKing Khefer§!, while well-meaning, has yet to prove himself anything but a far cry from the monarch his fellow ponies need him to be. §1Somnambula§!, who once served as a beacon of stability, has left on a self-imposed exile. §8Shaa Doof§!, the ailing Vizier and war hero, appears to be all that stands between the current, precarious status quo and the government’s total collapse. This chaos has only served to embolden and further radicalise the §tsocialist§! and §Lrepublican§! political elements, something which has, in turn, caused an uptick in reactionary activity.\n\nMaregypt is broken. Maregypt, land of necropolises, birthplace of Zebrican civilisation, is dying. But here, in these sands, the wise pony knows that death is never a certainty."
