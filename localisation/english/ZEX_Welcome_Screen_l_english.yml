 ZEX_Maregypt_History_Header_1:0 "§YBefore 810 ALB:0 Rise and Fall of the Maregyptian Empire§!"
 ZEX_Maregypt_History_Part_1:0 "As long as there has been a Neighle river, there has been a Maregyptian state. Whilst the exact borders of such a nation have invariably been subject to change - with Maregypt's influence ranging from the Neighle valley alone to vast stretches of western Zebrica.\n\nBut for all its monuments, storied splendour and grand necropolises, the exact origins of Maregypt have been lost to time. Some sources - such as Minetho of Prospero - claim that a disparate colony of Ponies were anointed as custodians of the land by princess Celestia herself not long after the Lunar banishment. Maregyptian sources on the other hand would claim that their nation was already in its golden age by the time Harmony made its way in their society. Modern historians however point to a blending of both, with some theories going as far as to claim that the ponies were not the first to settle the Neighle, and that their language, cultural practices and even their knowledge of agriculture had been inherited by preceding Donkey settlements. Regardless of the exact circumstances of Maregypt's birth, the Kingdom of Maregypt - as once again attested by Minetho - boasts a contiguous lineage of Kings and Queens stretching to the first century of this era; as long as the valley has been home to ponies, there was a Kingdom of Maregypt.\n\nGreat Pharaohs such as Namare of Trotebes, Ramanese the Second, Neyctaneb and even the heretic Akhenighten the Moon-Damned have left deep, permanent hoof-print on the pages of history. As the result of Maregyptians' efforts, the Neighle valley thrived, becoming not only the breadbasket of Zebrica but also one of the continent's civilisational crucibles.\n\nThe succession of great royal dynasties, from the Namarean dynasty in 260 BLB to the Thuthoofean dynasty in 670 ALB, Maregypt' rulers ushered in a series of veritable golden ages. This portion of Maregyptian history - from 560 BLB to 810 ALB is generally itself divided into three periods:0the Age of Heroes, the Age of Harmony and the Age of Empire. The Age of Heroes - or Old Maregypt - saw not only the first unification of Maregypt under King Namare, but also the exploits of great figures of legend, such as Somnambula, first contacts with Equestria and the completion of the first great Pyramid; the Age of Harmony was inaugurated following a brief period of civil strife and saw the wide adoption of precepts which are considered tradition by the modern Maregyptian pony:0Harmony, Royalty and Reverence; the Age of Empire marked both the apex of ancient Maregyptian civilisation and the beginning of its unravelling. Through a mix of diplomacy, growing economic might and - at times - war, Mareypt swelled and swelled.\n\nBut all empires fall, and a succession of political crises, famines, unpopular monarchs and general malaise led to Maregypt's slow decline and eventual fracture into three Kingdoms by 750 ALB, with the southern Kingdom of Zush and the northern Manephis Dynasties vying for power through a series of petty border conflicts as political unity wholly disintegrated."
 ZEX_Maregypt_History_Header_2:0 "§Y810 - 1003 ALB:0 Revival§!"
 ZEX_Maregypt_History_Part_2:0 "The chaotic interregnum was finally brought to a heel when under the leadership of the Neighpatan dynasty inaugurated by Ponye I. The new Zushite dynasty would go on to reunify Egypt with Abyssynian and later Equestrian assistance by 810 ALB. In 854 ALB however, the new Pharaoh, Tantamany II, was assassinated. This marked the end of the Zushite dynasty and the rise of the Trotanite Dynasty. The Trotanite Dynasty waged war on Abyssinia in an attempt to consolidate their state, breaking free from their rule and solidifying their control over the valley - though the Kingdom was by then no longer considered a key player in Zebrican affairs.\n\nThis latter period of Maregyptian history was characterised by a gradual increase in industrialisation, growing ties with Hippogriffia, and a progressive diplomatic withdrawal from central and western Zebrican affairs in favour of what historians dubbed the “North-Facing” policy. The Kingdom increasingly aligned itself with Equestria, greatly deepening both countries' trade relations. Furthermore, Maregyptian society increasingly modernised0 the old Sun-Worshipping and funerary cults were gradually phased out, the state adopted a more relaxed and Harmony-oriented monarchy - with the first proper constitution coming to be ratified by June 993 ALB. The second Pharaoh of the Trotanite dynasty, King Khaseneighy, began to lay the groundwork for a grand state-wide restructuring, and - for a time - it appeared that the Kingdom of Maregypt would enter a new golden era.\n\nBut that would not come to pass."
 ZEX_Maregypt_History_Header_3:0 "§Y1003 -1005 ALB:0 The Rending§!" 
 ZEX_Maregypt_History_Part_3:0 "The diplomatic retreat, reliance on Equestrian trade, political relaxing and general stagnation experienced by Maregypt in the tail-end of the first millennium left the Kingdom oblivious to the Storm-King's advance. The situation proved greatly exacerbated by King Snefru's aloofness and the blatant corruption of the aristocracy - leading to a near coup by the army in the summer of 1003 ALB. By the time the Yetis' armies had reached the Neighle, it was too late:0 the Maregyptian armies were slaughtered, and many cities laid low - though remnants of old Alicorn-gifted enchantments had managed to buy the Maregyptian soldiers some time.\n\nWith the Storm-King's attention drawn ever northward, King Snefru held on in front of Manephis for nearly a year with Equestrian and Hippogriffian help. And whilst the Tyran would meet his end in 1004 ALB, the Storm-King's armies managed to deal a final blow to Maregypt. King Snefru was slain - leaving his Vizier and loyal general, Shaa Doof, the task to lead the country in the interim as the young and inexperienced Prince Mardjed was spirited to Equestria.\n\nThe Rending - or Geresh - of Maregypt left the country in tatters. A hasty reconstruction effort, spearheaded by Equestrian investments, barely staved off total collapse. Yet this may have only delayed the inevitable. In the immediate aftermath, Shaa Doof led what remained of the government in an effort to both restore order and preserve the territorial integrity of Maregypt."
 ZEX_Maregypt_History_Header_4:0 "§Y1005 ALB and Onward:0 Modern Day§!"
 ZEX_Maregypt_History_Part_4:0 "With Prince Maredjed's return in 1005 ALB, and his coronation as King Khefer the First, a semblance of stability returned to the Kingdom. A particularly bountiful harvest as well as the restoration and empowerment of the Maredjay greatly increased the new Pharaoh's popularity - bringing legitimacy to an admittedly struggling government.\n\nHowever, not all is rosy in Maregypt. Separatist groups - including Zushite and Abyssinian militias - took advantage of the Storm-King's advance to organise themselves into competent fighting forces. Once allies, they now stand as enemies, ready to tear the kingdom apart from the inside. Communist, republican and even military elements have also begun making their play for power.\n\nThis leaves today's Maregypt in an ever-more precarious situation. Caught between the present and the past, Harmony and Zerbica, King and people, the Neighle valley is one stray bullet - one wrong word - away from descending into anarchy."
