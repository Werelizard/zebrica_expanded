 ZEX_Welcome_Screen_Info_Maregypt_Text:0 "Once a beacon of prosperity and stability - one of Zebrica's civilisational cradles - Maregypt is but a shadow of its former self. Rocked by instability and shackled by an antiquated bureaucracy, the country finds itself as the crossroads between anarchy, stagnation and empire. Gameplay-wise, Maregypt begins with two unique mechanics from the onset of the game: £ZEX_civilwartrigger  §Oprovincial unrest§! and the £ZEX_vizier_bop  §OBalance of Power§! - both of which are accessible through the £decision_icon_small §Ldecision§! menu."
 ZEX_Welcome_Screen_Lore_Maregypt_Text_Header:0 "§YThe Fading Sun§!"
 ZEX_Welcome_Screen_Lore_Maregypt_Text:0 "Maregypt, or Maresr, is amongst the oldest continuously existing nation in all of Zebrica. Famed for its bountiful farms, the beautiful Neighle river, innummerable tombs and great stone temples, it appears as a country frozen in time; ponies still toil their fields by hoof and plow, trains are but a novelty, factories have yet to blacken its sky and the majority of the populace remains tied to Maregyptian tradition. But yet, not all is well - far from it; in the wake of the Storm King's devastating onslaught and King Snefru's death, unrest threatens to boil over to revolution as the people struggle to afford bread. The Old and the New collide, and Harmony itself - once considered an essential  component of Maregypt's values, is now considered by many  to be but a burden.\n\nFounded over three thousand years ago, the country that would become Maregypt once began as eight disparate Kingdoms - chief amongst them was Trotebes, or as it was known then, as Neighpata. Under the leadership and guidance of its first Pharaoh, King Naarmare, the lands were united. This inaugurated the Old Maregyptian era and the first Mareyhptian empire. During this time such marvels as the four Great Pyramids, Hayrus' temple at Mareydum and - of course - the great royal necropolis of Hayxor were built. Of course, no empire is meant to outlast the sun, and with King Hoofas the Sixth' death, a civil war consumed the country. It was during this dark period of interregnum that the vile Sphinxes made their presence known. For two hundred years, they terrorised the land, subjugating ponies and zebras alike to their twisted whimsy. Thankfully, due to Queen Ahmes' itnervention the beasts were driven off and back to the deserts, where most of them would starve or devour one another.\n\nThis began the second age of Maregypt, the New Maregyptian era. It saw Maregypt, under Ramareses the Second - and later Neighfertiti's - guidance, expand to encompass vast chunks of western Zebrica, with an empire spanning from Tobuck to Mane'a and from Kamane to Panthera. It was said at the time that there was no Mare nor Alircorn which had not heard of Maregypt's glory. Most of Maregypt's legendary heroes found their beginings there: Somnambula the Hopeful, Imhotep the Clever, Saned of Manephis and Mesen the Bold. The great city of Manephis was also constructed, soldifying its place as the kingdom's beating heart. And so it was, for almost a thousand years. But alas, the peace could not last, and once more the Kingdom shattered, this time between the northern R'ataphet-centric Kingdom and the southern Zush dynasty. This starless-age, the second interregnum, saw many miseries and many tears. But, it also saw the arrival and entrenchment of Harmony.\n\nWith Celestia's counsel, the princes of Zush embraced friendship, Harmony and peace, and through tenacious negotiations brought back the country from the brink. Under this new creed, the country entered its third age: the era of Harmonic Maregypt. The country solidifed its ties with Equestria and began to foster good relations with both Hippogrifia and Alwani - returning the latter to its fold under a cadet branch of the Zush dynasty. This was not to say that tragedies were a thing of the past: King Nefermare the Third passed, leaving the rulership to his Vizier, Maredj Djeighfer, the great-great-grandfather of King Khefer. By then, the Kingdom has slowly stagnated, unable to move forward but unwilling to turn away from Harmony. With the arrival of the Storm King however, Pharaonic rule was almost shattered, barely salvaged by Equestrian intervention. This leaves Maregypt today in a precarious position: not broken, but at a crossroad. Only time will tell what path the country will take..."

 ZEX_Welcome_Screen_Characters_Maregypt_Text_Header:0 "§YThe Pharaoh's Court§!"
 ZEX_Welcome_Screen_Khefer_Name:0 "§YKing Khefer§!" 
 ZEX_Welcome_Screen_Khefer_Bio:0 "King Mardjed Nebe Khefer the Second is the eighty-second Pharaoh to have reigned over Maregypt. A staunch - if not naive - Harmonist, he spent the majority of his life in exile, only returning after his father's passing shortly before the Sotrm King's demise. Due to his young age and sheltered upbringing he remains relatively oblivious to the suffering of the masses and ongoing political climate, but his strong character guarantees that he will butt heads with anypony foolish enough to challenge his stuborness."
 ZEX_Welcome_Screen_Somnambula_Name:0 "§YSomnambula§!"
 ZEX_Welcome_Screen_Somnambula_Bio:0 "Born in the early days of Maregypt, long before Night Mare Moon's banishment, Somnambula is one of the old Pillars of Equestria, embodying the element of Hope. Having been rescued from limbo only recently, she emerged in a changed world, but her strong-headed personality, barevery and faith in harmony have motivated her return to the political scene. King Khefer more than enthusiastically welcomed her to Maregypt's court, offering her a position as an advisor to help guide him in these trying times."
 ZEX_Welcome_Screen_ShaaDoof_Name:0 "§YShaa Doof§!"
 ZEX_Welcome_Screen_ShaaDoof_Bio:0 "Maregypt's longest-serving Vizier, Shaa Doof has arguably seen more in his life than anypony ever will. A former soldier, journalist, ambassador and as a police officer, he is widely regarded as a heroic and stabilising figure - in particular having been commended for his slawart resolve in organising Somnambula's defence against the Storm King's forces. A pragmatic conservative, he sees has little faith in Harmony beyond using it as a unifying and diplomatic tool. His domineering presence and heavy-handed approach has caused particularly loud voices to demand his resignation."
 ZEX_Welcome_Screen_Ahmesi_Name:0 "§YAhmesi Senesfer§!"
 ZEX_Welcome_Screen_Ahmesi_Bio:0 "The current leader of the Maredjay - the Royal Guard and de facto State Police, Ahmesi Senesfer is also the King's cousin. A brilliant commander, ruthless politician and effective public speaker, she has made a name for herself as the leader of a splinter faction of the Semayt Heyter-ta en Haret, preaching a more conservative - if not outright reactionary - political pivot. She remains, however, staunchly loyal to her younger cousin, and will gladly lay her life down to protect him if such a need shall arise."
 ZEX_Welcome_Screen_Heqit_Name:0 "§YHeqit Bazin§!"
 ZEX_Welcome_Screen_Heqit_Bio:0 "Born of humble origins, Heqit Bazin first served as a priest - until the Storm came. Called to act as a resistance leader, he helped save countless lives. Once the war was over, he gained significant influance through his new career as a lawyer and then as a politician, now acting as the herald of Zebricanism, a progressive pan-nationalist ideology embracing a lighter form of socialism fused with Maregyptian tradition."
