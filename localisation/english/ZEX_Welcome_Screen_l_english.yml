 # Maregypt-Specific
 
 ZEX_Welcome_Screen_SickMare_Maregypt_Text_Header:0 "§YThe Sick Mare of Zebrica§!"
 ZEX_Welcome_Screen_SickMare_Maregypt_Text:0 "Maregypt - also known as Mareser or Heyter-ta - is amongst the oldest continuously existing countries currently extant in Zebrica, with its civilisation stretching back centuries before the Lunar Banishment. What had once been a proud empire, stretching from Tobuck to Mane'a, whose glories were known to every mare and pony throughout Equestria. Ruled by Kings and Queens, or Pharaohs, since its dawn, Maregypt is today caught between a glorious past and an uncertain future.\n\nHarmony, a cornerstone of Maregyptian society, grows increasingly unpopular. In fact, the Kingdom finds itself isolated; only Hippogriffia stands with Maregypt as twin strongholds of friendship. To make matters worse, the Storm King's advance devastated the countryside, exacerbating many of the aforementioned issues while also crippling the government's ability and leading to King Snefru's death. This caused some provinces to momentarily slip out the Kingdom's grasp, and though these have been nominally brought back into the fold, separatist movements remain a pervasive threat.\n\nThe country stands at the precipice, with the young and inexperienced King Khefer's just as likely to save as he is to doom the nation."
 ZEX_Welcome_Screen_LandOfTheSun_Maregypt_Text_Header:0 "§YOf the Reed and the Bee§!"
 ZEX_Welcome_Screen_LandOfTheSun_Maregypt_Text:0 "Under the leadership of King Narmare - Maregypt's first Pharaoh - the eight disparate kingdoms of the Neighle valley were first unified thousands of years ago. Brought together under his wise leadership, the Kingdom became a cradle of Zebrican civilisation. This first age of Maregyptian civilisation was an age of prosperity and peace, lasting until the death of King Hoofas the Sixth. As the Kingdom found itself without an heir, it descended into its first interregnum, one that saw the appearance of the Sphinxes.\n\nFor two hundred years, they terrorised the land, subjugating ponies and zebras alike to their twisted whimsy until Queen Ahmes banished the vile monsters, restored the Kingdom and returning friendship to the land. This heralded the second Maregyptian age, the age of legends. Heroes such as Somnambula the Hopeful began their stories around that time. It was also at that crucial moment in Maregyptian history that Harmony was first introduced, with many Kings and Queen coming to foster bonds with and entertain their Equestrian counterparts. The valley truly prospered, with a veritable Empire forming. At its apex - under the guidance of figures such as Ramareses and Neighfertiti - it encompassed a significant chunk of western Zebrica, with its glory known throughout the world entire. Its gilded temples were sanctuaries of faith and friendship, its cities bustling with artisans, scribes and poets.\n\nBut no empire is meant to outlast the sun. Shortly after the Lunar Banishment, the Kingdom collapsed in a three-way civil war. Vassal states such as Abyssinia and the eastern tribes broke free, Manephis was sacked, Zush was razed, and the line of Narmare was extinguished at last. Pony fought pony, zebra fought zebra. Maregypt retreated on itself, confined to the Neighle valley and delta. And yet, by some miracle, it held on. Through the leadership of Maredj Djeighfer, the ancestor of King Khefer, a new dynasty was founded, and the Kingdom was born anew. Harmony was restored and friendship prevailed for another milenia.\n\nHowever, it would never truly recover its past glories.Instead, the Kingdom stagnated. Even as the world changed, even as the Storm came and went, it refused - stubbornly - to evolve, stuck in the past.\n\n\n"

 ZEX_Welcome_Screen_Characters_Maregypt_Text_Header:0 "§YThe Pharaoh's Court§!"
 ZEX_Welcome_Screen_Khefer_Name:0 "§YKing Khefer§!" 
 ZEX_Welcome_Screen_Khefer_Bio:0 "King Mardjed Nebe Khefer the Second is the eighty-second Pharaoh to have reigned over Maregypt. A staunch - if not naive - Harmonist, he spent the majority of his life in exile, only returning after his father's passing shortly before the Sotrm King's demise. Due to his young age and sheltered upbringing he remains relatively oblivious to the suffering of the masses and ongoing political climate, but his strong character guarantees that he will butt heads with anypony foolish enough to challenge his stuborness."
 ZEX_Welcome_Screen_Somnambula_Name:0 "§YSomnambula§!"
 ZEX_Welcome_Screen_Somnambula_Bio:0 "Born in the early days of Maregypt, long before Night Mare Moon's banishment, Somnambula is one of the old Pillars of Equestria, embodying the element of Hope. Having been rescued from limbo only recently, she emerged in a changed world, but her strong-headed personality, barevery and faith in harmony have motivated her return to the political scene. King Khefer more than enthusiastically welcomed her to Maregypt's court, offering her a position as an advisor to help guide him in these trying times."
 ZEX_Welcome_Screen_ShaaDoof_Name:0 "§YShaa Doof§!"
 ZEX_Welcome_Screen_ShaaDoof_Bio:0 "Maregypt's longest-serving Vizier, Shaa Doof has arguably seen more in his life than anypony ever will. A former soldier, journalist, ambassador and as a police officer, he is widely regarded as a heroic and stabilising figure - in particular having been commended for his slawart resolve in organising Somnambula's defence against the Storm King's forces. A pragmatic conservative, he sees has little faith in Harmony beyond using it as a unifying and diplomatic tool. His domineering presence and heavy-handed approach has caused particularly loud voices to demand his resignation."
 ZEX_Welcome_Screen_Ahmesi_Name:0 "§YAhmesi Senesfer§!"
 ZEX_Welcome_Screen_Ahmesi_Bio:0 "The current leader of the Maredjay - the Royal Guard and de facto State Police, Ahmesi Senesfer is also the King's cousin. A brilliant commander, ruthless politician and effective public speaker, she has made a name for herself as the leader of a splinter faction of the Semayt Heyter-ta en Haret, preaching a more conservative - if not outright reactionary - political pivot. She remains, however, staunchly loyal to her younger cousin, and will gladly lay her life down to protect him if such a need shall arise."
 ZEX_Welcome_Screen_Heqit_Name:0 "§YHeqit Bazin§!"
 ZEX_Welcome_Screen_Heqit_Bio:0 "Born of humble origins, Heqit Bazin first served as a priest - until the Storm came. Called to act as a resistance leader, he helped save countless lives. Once the war was over, he gained significant influance through his new career as a lawyer and then as a politician, now acting as the herald of Zebricanism, a progressive pan-nationalist ideology embracing a lighter form of socialism fused with Maregyptian tradition."
